# Golem

The aim of the Golem project is to create a global prosumer market for computing power, in which
producers may sell spare CPU time of their personal computers and consumers may acquire resources
for computation-intensive tasks. In technical terms, Golem is designed as a decentralised peer-to-peer
network established by nodes running the Golem client software. For the purpose of this paper we assume
that there are two types of nodes in the Golem network: requester nodes that announce computing
tasks and compute nodes that perform computations (in the actual implementation nodes may switch
between both roles).
