<h4><u>Terms of Use of Concent Service</u></h4>
<p><em>Last Update: June 2019.</em></p>
<p>
    These Terms of Use of Concent Service (hereinafter the “Terms of Use”)
    shall serve as an agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions which
    will govern the use and participation in the Golem Concent Service
    (hereinafter the “Concent Service”).
</p>
<p>
    Concent Service is an optional network service built for the purpose of
    improving the integrity and security of the computational power marketplace
    (hereinafter the “Platform”) provided by Golem Factory GmbH
    (hereinafter the “Golem Factory”).
</p>
<p>
    By selecting the utilization of the Concent Service you shall also have
    indicated your acceptance of these Terms of Use, the Golem Factory GmbH
    Disclaimer, the Golem Factory GmbH User Interaction Guidelines and the
    Golem Factory GmbH Privacy Policy. All terms herein shall have the
    respective meaning as set forth in the User Interaction Guidelines,
    which can be found here:
    <a href="https://golem.network/privacy/">https://golem.network/privacy/</a>
    and here:
    <a href="https://golem.network/user-interaction-guidelines/">
        https://golem.network/user-interaction-guidelines/</a>.
    If you are unwilling to agree to these Terms of Use,
    the usage of the Concent Service shall be discontinued.
</p>
<p>
Agreement to the Terms of Use bonds the user as follows:
</p>

<h5>I. The Golem Project</h5>
<p>
    Golem Factory has conceptualized and developed a global, open source,
    decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access
    (hereinafter the “Golem Network”). The Golem Network enables users who
    are seeking additional computing power (“Requestors”) to rent it from users
    with idle resources (“Providers”; together the “Users” and/or “You”).
    The contractual relationship arises only between the Provider and the
    Requestor. Golem Factory does not form any part of the relationship between
    the Provider and/or Requestor exchanging computational power.
    Concent Service is an additional service of the Platform, with its own
    relationship between parts (Requestors, Providers) according to the rules
    and regulations set out in these Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
    By using the Golem Network along with the Concent Service, you represent
    and warrant that you are of the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction.
    This is a non-waiverable requirement to access the Golem Network and enter
    into arrangements as Provider or Requestor. You further represent that you
    are legally permitted to use the Golem Network in your jurisdiction
    including owning cryptographic tokens of value and interacting with
    the Golem Network in any way. You further represent you are responsible
    for ensuring a full compliance with the applicable laws in your
    jurisdiction and acknowledge that Golem Factory is not liable
    for your compliance and/or failure to comply with such laws.
</p>

<h5>II. The Concent Service</h5>
<p>
    Concent Service is an additional feature that Golem Factory has developed
    and makes available to all Users of the Golem Network who wish to enhance
    the integrity and processes of the Golem Network.
</p>
<p>
    The Concent Service is acting as an Oracle with a software-based validation
    method and a fully automated triggering system of payments according to
    predefined rules as set out in these Terms of Use. The automated asset
    allocation is based on a smart contract built on Ethereum (hereinafter
    the “GNT Deposit”) as further described below. Golem Factory has no direct
    control or access to the funds held in the GNT Deposit.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of the Concent Service is to enforce the integrity and security of
    the Golem Network by securing the execution of payments and the delivery of
    results of assigned computations for the Users of the Golem Network who
    have opted in on the Concent Service. Golem Network nodes can, and in
    certain circumstances will verify whether other nodes in the network have
    pledged the required amounts to GNT Deposit and only agree to work with
    them if that is indeed the case.
</p>
<p>
    If Users of the Golem Network who utilize the Concent Service interact in
    an unobstructed way, there will be no necessity for arbitrage through the
    Concent Service. The Concent Service only intervenes in User interactions
    in the Golem Network under predefined circumstances as set out in these
    Terms.
</p>
<p>
    The Users acknowledge that a 100% availability of the Concent Service is
    technically not possible. Golem Factory acts to the best of its power to
    make Concent Service available at all times. The maintenance or security
    concerns, as well as other force majeure events beyond Golem Factory’s
    control can lead to short-term disruptions or temporary suspension of the
    Concent Service. Golem Factory excludes, as far as legally permissible, the
    liability for all damages in connection with business interruptions.
</p>

<h5>III. Opt-In</h5>
<p>
    The Concent Service is non-mandatory and/or fully optional. Users may
    choose to opt-in and comply to these Terms of Use. The Concent Service will
    only intervene if necessary. The Providers and Requestors each have the
    possibility to opt-in to the Concent Service, if they meet the following
    requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accept these Terms of Use</li>
    <li>
        Have a minimum amount of GNT available on the account,
        in order to submit a deposit to the Concent Service.
        The minimum deposit fee shall be a minimum of twice the
        cost of a single subtask/job that was commissioned by
        a Requestor to a respective Provider.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have a minimum amount of ETH to cover the Ethereum transaction fee
        (also known as gas cost) when submitting the deposit.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    By opting-in to the Concent Service, each User accepts and agrees these
    Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
    As the Concent Service is an autonomous Oracle, Golem Factory has no direct
    control over the funds pledged to GNT Deposit smart contract by Golem
    Network nodes. Where required and only within the scope as described
    hereinafter, Concent Service can only enforce a payment of the amount
    pledged to the GNT Deposit by the Users of the Golem Network who have
    opted-in and the funds can only be transferred between the two parties
    within the boundaries of specific agreements between them and strictly
    under the circumstances described hereinafter. Alternatively, any funds
    not used up by the arbitrage can be transferred back to the Golem Network
    node that made the deposit while observing the enforced delay.
</p>
<p>
    Concent Services is not guaranteed to be free of charge. A small amount
    will be due, if Concent Service is requested by the Parties for additional
    verification of the results rendered (see also IV. e). Concent Service can
    charge the respective fee directly to the involved parties through
    GNT Deposit which can execute such transactions. If needed, Concent Service
    may also charge a small communication fee for each case it handles.
    You hereby consent to such transactions to be executed on your behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Golem Factory is not liable for any contact between the Users outside of
    the Scope of Concent Service. Golem Factory is not liable for any breach
    of duty arising from the contracts concluded between the Users (including
    non-fulfillment of a contract) and Golem Factory cannot be held responsible
    for the quality of any work results / computations ordered by a Requestor
    through the Golem Network. By acceptance of these Terms of Use, all Users
    acknowledge that Golem Factory only provides the technical applications to
    enable Requestors and Providers to interact with the Concent Service.
</p>

<h5>IV. Services</h5>
<p>
    The following functions form part of the Concent Service and each User of
    the Concent Service consents to these functions. By accepting the Terms of
    Use and actively opting-in to Concent Service, the User agrees that the
    Concent Service may perform these functions individually or in combination.
</p>
<p>
    Golem nodes - Providers and Requestors alike - communicate with the Concent
    Service using its communication endpoints to send and receive messages. In
    order to properly react when any Concent functions are triggered, both
    nodes must periodically poll the Concent’s receive endpoint to verify if
    there are any messages waiting for their reaction. Failure to receive and
    respond to a message waiting in the Concent Service’s queue within a time
    window of the given Concent scenario when the reaction of the particular
    node is required constitutes a failure of said scenario on given node’s
    end.
</p>
<h6>a. Enforcement of reports on the completion of a task</h6>
<p>
    Concent Service can assist Providers who are unable to report the
    successful completion of an assigned task to the Requestor through the
    usual peer-to-peer communication channel.
</p>
<p>
    In order to do that, the Concent Service requires the respective Requestor
    to receive the forced-report from the Concent and issue an acknowledgment
    to the Concent. The acknowledgement is then made available to the Provider
    and can in turn be used by the Provider to request payment from Requestor
    later.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, if the Requestor fails to respond to the awaiting force
    report message, Concent Service issues the proof of this failure to the
    Provider which allows the Provider to seek payment from the Requestor
    nevertheless. Should the Requestor subsequently refuse to pay the Provider
    for this task, the proof can be submitted to the Concent Service and the
    service will honor its own proof to enforce payment.
</p>
<h6>b. Enforcement of download of results</h6>
<p>
    If any problems should arise while downloading results of computational
    tasks from Provider, Requestor may persist that the Provider uploads the
    results to the Concent Service. After such successful upload, Concent
    Service will verify the integrity of the results and make the results
    available for the respective Requestor.
</p>
<p>
    However, should the upload to the Concent Service fail, Concent Service
    will provide the Requestor a corresponding proof of failure of the upload
    process and Requestor may use such proof to automatically issue a result
    rejection when asked about the verification verdict.
</p>
<h6>c. Enforcement of acceptance of results</h6>
<p>
    Should a Provider not receive a response regarding the results of the
    computational task they performed on behalf of the Requestor, after the
    results are delivered to the Requestor (either through the normal
    peer-to-peer communications channels or through Concent Service),
    a Provider can address Concent Service to acquire the verdict.
    The Concent Service will demand the verdict from the Requestor in turn
    and such verdict (whether it’s an acceptance or rejection of the results)
    will be relayed back to the Provider.
</p>
<p>
    Should the Requestor remain inactive and not react to the inquiry of the
    Concent Service, such inactivity will be assumed as acceptance of the
    results and the Concent Service will automatically allocate the outstanding
    payment to the Provider using the Requestors Concent Service deposit.
</p>
<h6>d. Enforcement of payment</h6>
<p>
    After completion of a computational task the Requestor has the appropriate
    time to make the payment to the Provider (Up to 24h). Should a Requestor
    not trigger the payment within the given timeframe, Provider can approach
    Concent Service in order to force payment using the Requestor’s deposit.
    Concent Service will then search the Ethereum Blockchain to verify if all
    enumerated payments have been completed between the Requestor and Provider.
    Should no matching transaction be identified or should the sum of
    identified transactions be lower than the sum of claims, Concent Service
    will then enforce the payment from the Requestor’s deposits to the Provider
    using the GNT Deposit smart contract.
</p>
<h6>e. Additional verification</h6>
<p>
    Should a Requestor reject a Provider’s result of a computational task,
    Provider has the possibility to verify the results with Concent Service
    acting as objective party. In order to make use of such service, Provider
    must make a deposit to Concent Service in the amount of minimum twice the
    cost of a single subtask/job that was commissioned by the Requestor to the
    respective Provider. When both parties have made their deposit and Concent
    Service has been provided the original request from the Requestor and the
    delivered result in question from Provider, Concent Service will run a
    verification of the results and thus verify if the rejection was justified.
</p>
<p>
    If Concent Service should deem the rejection of the results unjustified,
    Concent Service will force payment of the adequate amount from Requestor’s
    deposit to Provider and will charge an additional cost on top of the
    original claim to cover its own verification fee.
</p>
<p>
    Should however, Concent Service come to the conclusion that the results
    have been legitimately rejected, Concent Service will use the Provider’s
    deposit to cover the fee for the verification.
</p>
<p>
    In both cases, the verification fee shall be the cost of a single
    subtask/job that was commissioned by the Requestor to the respective
    Provider.
</p>
<p>
    You hereby acknowledge that the used verification method of
    non-deterministic computational results is probabilistic and as such,
    even when prepared with care, might not work correctly with all use cases
    and/or input data. Golem makes every reasonable effort to provide the
    correct functioning of such verifications.
</p>
