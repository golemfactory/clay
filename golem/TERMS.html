<h5><u>Disclaimer</u></h5>

<span>
This Disclaimer has been updated as of May 29, 2018.
<br/>
<br/>
Please read this Disclaimer carefully. By accessing
or using the Golem Network or Golem Website, you agree
to be bound by the terms described herein and all terms
incorporated by reference. If you do not agree to these
terms, do not use the Golem Network or the Golem Website.
</span>

<h6>I. The Golem Project</h6>
<span>
Golem Factory GmbH (the "Company") has conceptualized and
developed a global, open source, decentralized supercomputer
that anyone can access (the "Golem Network").
The Golem Network enables users, who are seeking additional
computing power ("Requestors") to rent it from users with
idle resources ("Providers"; together the "Users" and/or
"You"). The contractual relationship arises only
between the Provider and the Requestor and the Company
does not form any part of such relationship.
<br/><br/>
The underlying software protocol (the "Software") that
governs the Golem Network is developed and published under
the GNU General Public License version 3 which forms
an integral part of this Disclaimer
(https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
You understand and accept that the Software is provided
"as is" and any expressed or implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose
are disclaimed. In no event shall the Company be liable
of any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary,
or consequential damages (including, but not limited to,
procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of
use, data, or profits; or business interruption).
<br/><br/>
As the Software is of experimental nature and deployed
for testing purposes only, you acknowledge that this Beta
Version of the Software, even though developed
in accordance to state of the art, is likely to: (i)
contain bugs, defects, or errors (including any bug,
defect, or error relating to or resulting from the display,
manipulation, processing, storage, transmission, or use
of data) that materially and adversely affects the use,
functionality, or performance of the Golem Network
or any product or system containing or used in
conjunction with Golem.
<br/><br/>
Also, core to Golem's built-in feature set is a dedicated
Ethereum-based transaction system, which enables direct
payments between Requestors and Providers. All payments
in the Golem Network are made in GNT and require ETH as gas.
With the aim of reducing the costs for the Users,
the individual payment transactions are bundled
and carried out jointly as a bundle ("batching").
You hereby acknowledge that it may therefore take
up to 30 business days until payment transactions are executed.
<br/><br/>
GOLEM NETWORK IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND ANY REAL ETH OR GNT
SENT TO A LIKELY INSECURE SOFTWARE ARE AT RISK OF BEING LOST
INDEFINITELY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE RISK OF A NON-PAYMENT EVEN
AFTER 30 BUSINESS DAYS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GNT IN TESTNET
("tGNT") DO NOT CARRY ANY VALUE.
<br/><br/>
</span>

<h6>II. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h6>
<span>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE SOFTWARE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COMPANY PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</span>

<h6>III. Limitation of Liability.</h6>
<span>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN WRITING WILL THE COMPANY, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
AND/OR CONVEYS THE SOFTWARE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE WITH
ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR THE NON-PAYMENT OF A FEE ), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</span>

<h6>IV. Account Password and Security.</h6>
<span>
When setting up an account within the Golem Network,
it is your sole responsibility to keep your own account
secrets, in particular the password you set during
at the first launch of the application. You agree
to (a) never use the same password for the Golem Network
that you have ever used outside of this service;
(b) keep your secret information and password confidential
and do not share them with anyone else. The Company
cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
arising from your failure to comply with this section.
There is no possibility for the Company to recover
your private password.
</span>

<h6>V. Assumption of Risks of Cryptographic Systems
and Currencies</h6>
<span>
By using the Golem Network in any way, you acknowledge
the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems;
and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage
and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like
GNT or ETH, smart contract based tokens such as those
that follow the Ethereum Token Standard and
blockchain-based software systems.
<br/><br/>
You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain
technologies and associated currencies or tokens
are highly volatile due to many factors including
but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology
and security risks. You also acknowledge that
the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable
and may increase at any time causing impact
to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain.
You acknowledge these risks and represent that
the Company cannot be held liable for such fluctuations
or increased costs.
<br/><br/>
You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for
the process of selling and buying GNT or ETH
and that the Company does not offer any such service.
The Company cannot be held liable for any losses or
damages of GNT, ETH or other Cryptocurrencies resulting
from the use of services of any third-party provider
(i.e. exchanges).
</span>

<h6>VI. Assumption of Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or
More Jurisdictions</h6>
<span>
The Golem Network and Ethereum could be impacted
by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory
action, which could impede or limit the ability of
the Company to continue to develop, or which could
impede or limit your ability to access or use
the Golem Network or Ethereum blockchain.
<br/><br/>
The Company endeavours to comply with all applicable
laws, i.e. all legal requests for information, and
reserve the right to provide information, including
Project Information, to law enforcement personnel and
other third parties to answer inquiries, to respond
to legal process, to respond to the order of a court of
competent jurisdiction and those exercising the court's
authority and to protect the Golem Network and
its Users.
</span>

<h6>VII. Services and Availability</h6>
<span>
All Users acknowledge that the Company only provides
the technical applications to enable the contact between
the Requestors and Providers. The Company is not liable
for any contact between the Users. The Company is not
liable for any breach of duty arising from the contracts
concluded between the Users (including non-fulfillment
of a contract) and the Company can not be held responsible
for the quality of any work results / computations ordered
by a Requestor through the Golem Network. The Users are
solely responsible for the execution and fulfilment of
the contracts between Requestors and Providers.
<br/><br/>
The Users acknowledge that a 100% availability of the
Golem Network is technically not possible. Events beyond
the Company's control can lead to short-term disruptions
or temporary suspension of the Golem Network. The Company
excludes, as far as legally permissible, liability for
all damages in connection with service interruptions.
</span>

<h6>VIII. Personal Data</h6>
<span>

but rather shared directly between the Users, the Company
does not qualify as a data controller or data processor
as defined in Article 4 GDPA. The Users understand that
the Company has no control over the Personal Information
provided to other Users of Golem Network and agree to not hold
the Company liable for any misuse of Personal Information
by other Users of Golem Network. The Users further understand
that the Personal Information is not recorded, processed
or stored by the Company. Consequently, the rights of the Users
relating to their Personal Information as provided in the GDPR
cannot be asserted against the Company.
</span>

<h6>IX. Indemnification</h6>
<span>
You agree to release and to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company and its parents, subsidiaries,
affiliates and agencies, as well as the officers,
directors, employees, shareholders and representatives
of any of the foregoing entities, from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages, costs
(including attorneys' fees and court costs) claims or
actions of any kind whatsoever arising or resulting
from your use of the Software, your violation of this
Disclaimer, and any of your acts or omissions that
implicate publicity rights, defamation or invasion of
privacy. If you are obligated to indemnify
the Company, Company reserves the right, at its own
expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of
