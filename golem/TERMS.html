<h4><u>Disclaimer</u></h4>
<p>
    This Disclaimer has been updated as of Apr 1, 2019.
</p>
<p>
    Please read this Disclaimer carefully. By accessing or using the
    Golem Network or Golem Website, you agree to be bound by the terms
    described herein and all terms incorporated by reference. If you do not
    agree to these terms, do not use the Golem Network or the Golem Website.
</p>

<h5>I. The Golem Project</h5>
<p>
    Golem Factory GmbH (the "Company") has conceptualized and developed a
    global, open source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access
    (the "Golem Network"). The Golem Network enables users, who are seeking
    additional computing power ("Requestors") to rent it from users with idle
    resources ("Providers"; together the "Users" and/or "You").
    The contractual relationship arises only between the Provider and the
    Requestor and the Company does not form any part of such relationship.
</p>
<p>
    The underlying software protocol (the "Software") that governs the Golem
    Network is developed and published under the GNU General Public License
    version 3 which forms an integral part of this Disclaimer
    (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>).
    You understand and accept that the Software is provided "as is" and any
    expressed or implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
    particular purpose are disclaimed.
    In no event shall the Company be liable of any direct, indirect,
    incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including,
    but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services;
    loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption).
</p>
<p>
    As the Software is of experimental nature and deployed for testing purposes
    only, you acknowledge that this Beta Version of the Software, even though
    developed in accordance to state of the art, is likely to: (i) contain
    bugs, defects, or errors (including any bug, defect, or error relating to
    or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing, storage,
    transmission, or use of data) that materially and adversely affects the
    use, functionality, or performance of the Golem Network or any product or
    system containing or used in conjunction with Golem.
</p>
<p>
    Also, core to Golem's built-in feature set is a dedicated Ethereum-based
    transaction system, which enables direct payments between Requestors and
    Providers. All payments in the Golem Network are made in GNT and require
    ETH as gas. With the aim of reducing the costs for the Users,
    the individual payment transactions are bundled and carried out jointly as
    a bundle ("batching"). You hereby acknowledge that it may therefore take up
    to 30 business days until payment transactions are executed.
</p>
<p>
    GOLEM NETWORK IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND ANY REAL ETH OR GNT
    SENT TO A LIKELY INSECURE SOFTWARE ARE AT RISK OF BEING LOST
    INDEFINITELY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE RISK OF A NON-PAYMENT EVEN
    AFTER 30 BUSINESS DAYS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GNT IN TESTNET
    ("tGNT") DO NOT CARRY ANY VALUE.
</p>

<h5>II. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h5>
<p>
    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE SOFTWARE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
    BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
    COMPANY PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
    AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
    THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>

<h5>III. Limitation of Liability.</h5>
<p>
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
    IN WRITING WILL THE COMPANY, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
    AND/OR CONVEYS THE SOFTWARE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
    TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL
    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
    TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
    OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
    OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE WITH
    ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR THE NON-PAYMENT OF A FEE ), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
    OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p>

<h5>IV. Account Password and Security.</h5>
<p>
    When setting up an account within the Golem Network, it is your sole
    responsibility to keep your own account secrets, in particular the password
    you set during at the first launch of the application. You agree to:
    (a) never use the same password for the Golem Network that you have ever
    used outside of this service;
    (b) keep your secret information and password confidential and do not
    share them with anyone else.
    The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising
    from your failure to comply with this section.
    There is no possibility for the Company to recover your private password.
</p>

<h5>V. Assumption of Risks of Cryptographic Systems and Currencies</h5>
<p>
    By using the Golem Network in any way, you acknowledge the inherent risks
    associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an
    understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens,
    like GNT or ETH, smart contract based tokens such as those that
    follow the Ethereum Token Standard and blockchain-based software systems.
</p>
<p>
    You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain technologies and
    associated currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors
    including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and
    security risks.
    You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is
    variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities
    taking place on the Ethereum blockchain.
    You acknowledge these risks and represent that the Company cannot be held
    liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the process of selling
    and buying GNT or ETH and that the Company does not offer any such service.
    The Company cannot be held liable for any losses or damages of GNT, ETH or
    other Cryptocurrencies resulting from the use of services of
    any third-party provider (i.e. exchanges).
</p>

<h5>VI. Assumption of Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions</h5>
<p>
    The Golem Network and Ethereum could be impacted by one or more regulatory
    inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of
    the Company to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your
    ability to access or use the Golem Network or Ethereum blockchain.
</p>
<p>
    The Company endeavours to comply with all applicable laws, i.e. all legal
    requests for information, and reserve the right to provide information,

    applications to enable the contact between the Requestors and Providers.
    The Company is not liable for any contact between the Users.
    The Company is not liable for any breach of duty arising from the contracts
    concluded between the Users (including non-fulfillment of a contract) and
    the Company can not be held responsible for the quality of any work results
    / computations ordered by a Requestor through the Golem Network.
    The Users are solely responsible for the execution and fulfilment of
    the contracts between Requestors and Providers.
</p>
<p>
    The Users acknowledge that a 100% availability of the Golem Network is
    technically not possible. Events beyond the Company's control can lead to
    short-term disruptions or temporary suspension of the Golem Network.
    The Company excludes, as far as legally permissible, liability for all
    damages in connection with service interruptions.
</p>

<h5>VIII. Personal Data</h5>
<p>

</p>

<h5>VII. Personal Information</h5>

<h6>External Network Monitor</h6>
<p>
    The Company maintains an external network monitor that shows various
    network statistics of the Golem Network and displays them to the public.
    The external network monitor allows the Company to gather data regarding
    functioning of the network and nodes in order to constantly improve and
    upgrade the network protocol and the Golem application.
    When the user downloads and installs the Golem application, he or she will
    be asked during the installation procedure whether he or she wishes to
    contribute certain information about his or her node and the usage of the
    application to the external network monitor. If the user decides to opt-in
    to contribute network statistics to the Company, the following information
    relating to the user's use of the application ("External Statistics") will
    be transferred to the Company and published on
    <a href="https://stats.golem.network/show">https://stats.golem.network/show</a>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Node ID</li>
    <li>Node Name</li>
    <li>Node Version</li>
    <li>Last Time Seen</li>
    <li>Operating System</li>

    <li>Subtasks with Error</li>
    <li>Subtasks with Timeout</li>
    <li>P2P Protocol Version</li>
    <li>Task Protocol Version</li>
    <li>Number of Tasks Requested</li>
    <li>Number of Known Tasks</li>
    <li>Number of Supported Tasks</li>
    <li>
        Requestor Statistics, including tasks, finished tasks,
        requested subtasks, collected results, verified results,
        subtasks with timeout, downloadable tasks, failed subtasks,
        work offers)
    </li>
    <li>
        Provider Statistics including requested subtasks, received subtasks,
        total time between subtask request and assignment
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The storing and publishing of the External Statistics is required in order
    to display it on the external network monitor. The user understands that
    the External Statistics published on the external network monitor are
    available to the public, including individuals and legal entities that do
    not use the Golem Network. The External Statistics transferred to the
    Company will be updated on a regular basis and therefore continuously
    replaced with more current information. This means that the external
    monitor represents a real time reflection of the Golem Network and that
    all the data displayed in the external monitor is being overwritten in
    real time.
</p>
<p>
    The processing of the information by storing and publishing the External
    Statistics on the external network monitor is based on the user's consent
    pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. a GDPR. The user shall have the right to
    withdraw his or her consent at any time. If the user wishes to end his or
    her contribution of External Statistics to the external network monitor,
    he or she can opt out by using the command line interface of the Golem
    application. In this case, the information will be immediately excluded
    from being displayed on the network monitor.
</p>

<h6>Internal Network Monitor</h6>
<p>
    The Company maintains an internal network monitor that collects various
    network statistics of the Golem Network. The internal network monitor
    allows the Company to gather data regarding functioning of the network
    and nodes in order to constantly improve and upgrade the network protocol
    and the Golem application. The network statistics stored in the internal
    network monitor are also used to improve the performance of the Golem
    Network but are more informative and accurate than the External Statistics.
</p>
<p>
    When the user downloads and installs the Golem application, he or she will
    be asked during the installation procedure whether he or she wishes to
    contribute certain information about his or her node and the usage of the
    application to the internal network monitor. If the user decides to opt-in
    to contribute network statistics to the Company, the following information
    relating to the user's use of the application ("Internal Statistics")
    will be transferred to the Company and stored on its internal servers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Node ID</li>
    <li>Node Name</li>
    <li>Node Version</li>
    <li>Last Time Seen</li>
    <li>Operating System</li>
    <li>Network IP</li>
    <li>Start Port</li>
    <li>End Port</li>
    <li>Performance Index</li>
    <li>Allowed Resource Size</li>
    <li>Allowed Resource Memory</li>
    <li>CPU Cores</li>
    <li>Minimum Price</li>
    <li>Maximum Price</li>
    <li>Subtasks Completed with Success</li>
    <li>Subtasks with Error</li>
    <li>Subtasks with Timeout</li>
    <li>P2P Protocol Version</li>
    <li>Task Protocol Version</li>
    <li>Number of Tasks Requested</li>
    <li>Number of Known Tasks</li>
    <li>Number of Supported Tasks</li>
    <li>Requestor Statistics, including tasks, finished tasks, requested subtasks, collected results, verified results, subtasks with timeout, downloadable tasks, failed subtasks, work offers)</li>
    <li>Provider Statistics, requested subtasks, received subtasks, total time between subtask request and assignment</li>
    <li>OS version</li>
    <li>OS release date</li>
    <li>OS edition</li>
    <li>OS user name (can be persons first and last name)</li>
    <li>Public key</li>
    <li>Provider incomes statistics</li>
    <li>Requestor payments statistics</li>
    <li>Marketplace statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The storing of the Internal Statistics on the servers of the Company is
    required to display it on the internal monitor and to analyze it in order
    to improve the performance of the Golem Network. In contrast to the
    External Statistics, the Internal Statistics are not replaced with but
    rather continuously enhanced by more current information. The internal
    monitor is therefore a historical reflection of the Golem Network,
    providing the Company with an overview of everything that has happened on
    the Golem Network in the past. The Internal Statistics are not available to
    the public and are not being shared with third parties.
</p>
<p>
    The processing of the information by storing the Internal Statistics on
    the internal network monitor is based on the user's consent pursuant to
    Article 6(1) lit. a GDPR. The user shall have the right to withdraw his or
    her consent at any time. If the user wishes to end his or her contribution
    of information to the network monitor, he or she can opt out by using the
    command line interface of the Golem application. To delete personal data
    that has already been submitted to the Company, the user can contact the
    Controller.
</p>

<h6>Sentry Service for Error Tracking</h6>
<p>
    The Company uses an open-source error tracking service called Sentry that
    is offered by Functional Software, Inc. domiciled in San Francisco and
    provides real-time error tracking for web applications Sentry
    ("Sentry Sentry"). The information collected by the Sentry Service and
    provided to the Company gives the Company the insight needed to reproduce
    and fix crashes that happen in the Golem Network.
</p>
<p>
    When the user downloads and installs the Golem application, he or she will
    be asked during the installation procedure whether he or she wishes to
    contribute information about errors happening in his or her node to the
    Sentry Service, including the node name. If the user decides to opt-in to
    contribute such error information, all errors that happen in the user's
    nodes as well as the name of the node are automatically sent to the Company
    ("Error Information"). All other data related to the error is filtered and
    encrypted so that the Company is not able to access it. The Error
    Information sent to the Company is subsequently stored on the Company's
    servers in the form of logs.
</p>
<p>
    The storing of the Error Information on the servers of the Company is
    required for the Company to be able to prioritize the most common errors
    that happen in the Golem Network and fix them in the proper order. The
    Company will delete the Error Information as soon as it is no longer
    required for the purpose for which it was collected. The Error Information
    is not available to the public and is not being shared with third parties.
</p>
<p>
    The processing of the information by storing the Error Information on the
    servers of the Company is based on the user's consent pursuant to
    Article 6(1) lit. a GDPR. The user shall have the right to withdraw his or
    her consent at any time. If the user wishes to end his or her contribution
    of information to the network monitor, he or she can opt out by using the
    command line interface of the Golem application.
</p>

<h5>VIII. Jurisdiction and Governing Law</h5>
<p>
    Any dispute between the Users and the Company shall be submitted to the
    exclusive jurisdiction of the competent Courts of Zug, Switzerland, with
    the exclusion of any other jurisdiction or arbitration.
</p>

<p>
    This Disclaimer shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in
    accordance with the substantive laws of Switzerland, excluding the Swiss
    conflict of law rules. The United Nations Convention for the
    International Sales of Goods ("Vienna Sales Convention") is excluded.
