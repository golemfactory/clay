<h6>Disclaimer</h6>

This Disclaimer has been updated as of [Date].

<h6>I. The Golem Project</h6>
<span>
Golem Factory GmbH (the “Company”) has conceptualized
and developed a global, open sourced, decentralized
supercomputer that anyone can access <br/>
(the “Golem Network”). The Golem Network enables users,
who are seeking additional computing power
(“Requestors”) to rent it from users with idle
resources (“Providers”; together the “Users”
and/or “You”). The underlying software protocol
(the “Software”) that governs the Golem Network
is developed and published under the GNU General
Public License version 3 which forms an integral
part of this Disclaimer (https://fsf.org/).
<br/><br/>
THE SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT TO THE ETHEREUM MAINNET IS
MADE FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY. You understand and
accept that the Software is provided “as is” and any
expressed or implied warranties of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed.
In no event shall the Company be liable of any direct,
indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or
consequential damages (including, but not limited to,
procurement of substitute goods or services; loss
of use, data, or profits; or business interruption).
<br/><br/>
As the Software is of experimental nature and deployed
for testing purposes only, you acknowledge that this
Beta Version of the Software, even though developed
in accordance to state of the art, is likely to: (i)
contain bugs, defects, or errors (including any bug,
defect, or error relating to or resulting from the
display, manipulation, processing, storage,
transmission, or use of data) that materially and
adversely affects the use, functionality, or
performance of the Golem Network or any product or
system containing or used in conjunction with Golem.
<br/><br/>
Also, core to Golem’s built-in feature set is
a dedicated Ethereum-based transaction system, which
enables direct payments between Requestors and
Providers. All payments between Users of Golem are
made in Golem (“GNT”) and require Ethereum (“ETH”)
as gas. With the aim of reducing the costs for
the Users, the individual payment transactions are
bundled and carried out jointly as a bundle
(“batching”). You hereby acknowledge that it may
therefore take up to [X] business days until payment
transactions are executed.
<br/><br/>
THIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND LIKELY INSECURE
SOFTWARE ANY REAL ETH OR GNT SENT TO IT ARE AT RISK
OF BEING LOST INDEFINITELY.
<br/><br/>
</span>
<h6>II. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h6>
<span>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE SOFTWARE, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COMPANY PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE
“AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</span>
<h6>III. Limitation of Liability.</h6>
<span>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL THE COMPANY, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE SOFTWARE AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR THE NON-PAYMENT OF A FEE ),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</span>
<h6>IV. Account Password and Security.</h6>
<span>
When setting up an account within the Golem Network,
you will be responsible for keeping your own account
secrets, which may be a twelve-word seed phrase,
an account file, or other locally stored secret
information. The Software encrypts this information
locally with a password you provide, that is never
sent to the Company servers. The Company cannot and
will not be liable for any loss or damage arising
from your failure to comply with this section.
There is no possibility for the Company to recover
your private password.
</span>
<h6>V. Assumption of Risks of Cryptographic Systems
and Currencies</h6>
<span>
By using the Golem Network in any way, you represent
that you understand the inherent risks associated with
cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have
an understanding of the usage and intricacies of
native cryptographic tokens, like Ether (ETH),
smart contract based tokens such as those that
follow the Ethereum Token Standard and
blockchain-based software systems.
<br/><br/>
You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain
technologies and associated currencies or tokens are
highly volatile due to many factors including but
not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and
security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of
transacting on such technologies is variable and
may increase at any time causing impact to
any activities taking place on the Ethereum
blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent
that the Company cannot be held liable for such
fluctuations or increased costs.
</span>
<h6>VI. Assumption of Risk of Regulatory Actions
in One or More Jurisdictions</h6>
<span>
The Golem Network and Ethereum could be impacted
by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory
action, which could impede or limit the ability of
the Company to continue to develop, or which could
impede or limit your ability to access or use
the Golem Network or Ethereum blockchain.
<br/><br/>
The Company endeavours to comply with all applicable
laws, i.e. all legal requests for information, and
reserve the right to provide information, including
Project Information, to law enforcement personnel and
other third parties to answer inquiries, to respond

competent jurisdiction and those exercising the court’s
authority and to protect the Golem Network and
its Users.

harmless the Company and its parents, subsidiaries,
